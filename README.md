# Reinforcement-Learning
Internship in Reinforcement Learning at J.A Dieudonné Laboratory under the guidance of M. François Delarue. 

Reinforcement Learning is a Machine Learning (ML) technique that trains software to make decisions to achieve the most optimal results without fully knowing the environement. It mimics the trial-and-error learning process that humans use to achieve their goals. In this internship project, using Gridworld as a testing environnmet, I've implemented algorithms that can find the optimal strategy. Here is the list of the algorithms: 

- Fully observable, known model :
    - Value Iteration (gives the optimal values and policy)
    - Policy Evaluation (gives the value of a policy) 

- Fully observable, unknown model :
    - Adaptive Dynamic Programming passive Agent (ADP agent for short)
    - Temporel Difference passive Agent (TD agent)
    - Q-learning active Agent

The Gridworld environments are stochastic and include obstacles. 

I've created a game using pygame too that can show us those agents in action or just to play it freely. Check it out !!
